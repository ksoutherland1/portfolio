            <h1>Hello! I'm Kate Southerland, a full-stack engineer and ancient history enthusiast.</h1>
            <p id="welcome">Given its military pre-eminence, Sparta was recognized as the leading force of the unified Greek military during the Greco-Persian Wars, in rivalry with the rising naval power of Athens.[2] Sparta was the principal enemy of Athens during the Peloponnesian War (431–404 BC),[3] from which it emerged victorious after the Battle of Aegospotami. The decisive Battle of Leuctra in 371 BC ended the Spartan hegemony.</p>
