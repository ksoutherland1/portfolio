            <h1>Hello! I'm Kate Southerland, an aspiring software engineer and ancient history enthusiast.</h1>
            <p id="welcome">Welcome to my website! I am thrilled to share my passion for seeking out structural integrity issues in everything from the code of my peers to the expansion of caste systems in Ancient Sparta. My creative yet analytical nature lends me to problem-solving and innovation as I find ways to make my code more efficient.</p>

                <p> Given its military pre-eminence, Sparta was recognized as the leading force of the unified Greek military during the Greco-Persian Wars, in rivalry with the rising naval power of Athens.[2] Sparta was the principal enemy of Athens during the Peloponnesian War (431–404 BC),[3] from which it emerged victorious after the Battle of Aegospotami. The decisive Battle of Leuctra in 371 BC ended the Spartan hegemony, although the city-state maintained its political independence until its forced integration into the Achaean League in 192 BC. </p>
